When an auction session ends, tasks need to be performed in order to complete
the bidding process. There are also several places where scheduled/delayed tasks
are needed in the application.

Property items are said to be ``available'' if the \emph{available} option is
turned on by user (it is ``on'' by default when created) and there are no bids
in all the previous auction sessions in the same day. When the local time
reaches the end time of the session, the system have to check whether there are
bids in the session and create a booking for the winner. Property items that has
been booked out has to be marked as ``unavailable'' so that it does not come up
in the search results. Furthermore, property item has to be re-listed (marked
as ``available'') at 12 noon every day.

\subsubsection{Django Signals}
Signals are dispatched in Django when a certain action is performed within the
framework. It helps decoupled applications to get notified when the actions are
taken placed~\cite{django-signals}. Django provides a set of built-in signals
that allows us to combine it with Celery to perform certain tasks when signals
are dispatched. A list of signals we used in the project are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{django.db.models.signals.m2m\_changed}
  \item \texttt{django.db.models.signals.pre\_save}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Celery Beat}
Celery beat is a scheduler in Celery that kicks off tasks at regular intervals,
that are then executed by available worker nodes in the cluster~\cite{celery-beat}.
The worker works asynchronously to start task execution and store results in
a Redis instance.

By default, beat uses \texttt{PersistentScheduler} that keeps track of the last
run in a local shelve\footnote{a persistent, dictionary-like object} database
file. But that is not necessary since we already have a PostgreSQL database
active in the backend. So we instead use an extension
django-celery-beat~\ref{sec:dep-celery-beat} that allows us to store tasks in
the Django database through a \texttt{DatabaseScheduler}. The extension also
provides an admin interface so that tasks could be managed by the administrator.

\paragraph{Periodic Task}
\texttt{PeriodicTask} is a Django model provided by
django-celery-beat~\ref{sec:dep-celery-beat} that simulates how Celery tasks are
represented in the database. We use this in conjunction with
\texttt{DatabaseScheduler} to provide background services in the Django
framework.

\subsubsection{Combining both signals and Celery beat}
There are two tasks to be completed in the background:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item check if anyone bid on a property item; if there is, a booking is added
    to the winner's account, and bids associated with the property item are
    removed. Property item is marked as ``unavailable'' as well. Otherwise we do
    nothing about that property item.
  \item enable bidding for all property items at 12 noon
\end{enumerate}
As such, we define two tasks in Celery accordingly: \texttt{cleanup\_bids} and
\texttt{enable\_bids}. Whenever an auction session is added to a property item
(\texttt{m2m\_changed}), we add a \texttt{PeriodicTask} to the database that
executes \texttt{cleanup\_bids}. A \texttt{PeriodicTask} that executes
\texttt{enable\_bids} is added when a property item is
saved (\texttt{pre\_save}). When celery is launched, the scheduler will pick up
the tasks and triggers tasks execution when time reaches.
