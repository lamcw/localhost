# Week 2

Group formed with the other three undergraduates in the lab. Adopted the
role of scrum master. I created the Slack workspace, Trello team and project
board, and BitBucket repository. Managed each of the tasks on Trello and
assigned them to respective team members. Organised a second meeting to be
held on Wednesdays. Drafted the abstract, and project methodology sections of
the proposal document.

# Week 3

The group finished the project proposal. Compiled each of the sections for
the shared google docs page into a latex file and submitted for the group. Had
our first out of class meeting on Wednesday to discuss the direction of the
project. Further disussed what platforms and technologies to use and we decided
on the bootstrap and django frameworks with AWS for hosting. Everyone committed
to complete certain tasks within the next two weeks.

# Week 4

Official meetings ran successfully on Wednesday and Thursday. I organised
another unofficial meeting on Friday night that hopes to run weekly. This
week the team spent several hours discussing the different conceptual problems
with the current model and the model was changed accordingly with unanimously
agreed upon solutions. Steven and I focussed primarly on designing the user
interfaces and together we sketched a proposed design for each of the website
pages and presented them to the group for feedback. Together we implemented the
first version of the website homepage incorporating a search bar and researched
different APIs that can be used for the location autocomplete the project
requires.

# Week 5

Official meetings ran successfully on Wednesday and Thursday. The unofficial
friday night meetings are now running weekly. I worked on the homepage and
refactored much of the existing code so that the codebase is more modular. I
added features such as randomly generated search bar placeholder text and
randomly chosen wallpapers.

# Week 6

Official meetings ran, again, successfully on Wednesday and Thursday. The
unofficial friday meeting also went ahead. In order to meet the goal of the
sprint, I proposed another meeting on Sunday and we put in 20+ man hours extra.

This week I refactored the front end to depend on a fluxbox layout and with the
help of Steven migrated all the previous pages to the new codebase.
Additionally, I developed the log in, register and password reset pages.

Progress is on track.

# Week 7

During the unofficial Friday meeting this week, the conceptual design and
problem domain was made stricter to prioritise refined features over being
feature rich. This was done in a way that still meets the proposal
specifications but relieves pressure on the developers. I spent several hours
working through this with the team. A project "codename" was finally decided.
I also designed a prototype messaging page. Along with Tom, who is working on
the back end of the project, we designed and implemented the page that allows
users to create listings.

# Week 8

Official meetings ran on Wednesday and Thursday. The fortnightly demo happened
the Thursday meeting. This week I merged the front end development branch into
the primary development branch. In addition, I refactored a number of the pages
to be significantly more modular and dependent on Django includes. Over the
week, Ed and I researched different technologies and tools we could use for
the real time bidding feature of the website. We settled on using Redis over
Django channels and on Friday night we worked together on a prototype branch
and implemented a proof of concept. At the end of the week I applied for AWS
Educate so that we would have access to a server for development, testing and
the final demonstration.

# Week 9

Official meetings ran as per usual. On Monday, I started, finished, and merged
a major UI upgrade (12+ consecutive man hours). Later in the week I configured
the AWS server. I wrote a number of bash scripts to to configure the nginx web
server, to configure the web server gateway, to restart services, and to
automate dropping, migrating and repopulation of the database, I also bought a
domain for the web server (h11a.xyz) and configured the server to use HTTPS
through the Lets Encrypt platform. During the Wednesday meeting I worked with
Ed to define the protocol used for socket communication between the clients
and server.

# Mid-semester break

Over the mid-semester break I investigated different libraries and frameworks
that could be used for real-time communication. I ended up writing a
cooperative multiplex socket library in JavaScript and two Python classes for
the server. Together they enable clients and the server to communicate almost
instantly. I migrated the current bidding page to use the library. Afterwards,
I configured the server for Django Channels and enabled SSL for web sockets.

# Week 10

This week I migrated the deployment away from uWSGI and to Gunicorn. I
additionally wrote service scripts for Gunicorn and Daphne to automate
installation. I redesigned the homepage, splash page and public profile page
according to recommendations from the user tests.

# Week 11

This week I worked with Tom to get Celery working. I also wrote service scripts
and updated the server configuration files to be more modular and clean.
The remaining time was spent working through the various open issues (bugs and
minor enhancements) on BitBucket.

# Week 12

Minor refactoring and working through BitBucket issues.
