# Instruction Set
1. **Create a user account and login**
*User difficulty rating (Out of 5):* 3
*Supervisor comments*:
Too many security requirements for password
Should be a pop-up or modal to prompt user that account has been created. Any confirmation.
Recommends that dob and gender should not be required for signup, but part of profile creation
that user can do later. Lower barrier of entry

2. **Add $150 to your wallet**
*User difficulty rating (Out of 5):* 4 for navigation
*Supervisor comments*:
Tabs are faint on dashboard, hard for people with poor eyesight to see
Confirmed for recharge success

3. **Search for a listing in kingsford**
*User difficulty rating (Out of 5):* 3, could be higher if navigation was clearer
*Supervisor comments*:
Needs a clearer home button on dashboard
The search bar was not distinguishable
Since enter button doesn't work, instead of saying "Try Kingsford", tell them to select Kingsford or something

4. **Submit a bid on first listing in first property in search results**
*User difficulty rating (Out of 5):* 3
*Supervisor comments*:
Confirmation that bid was succesful
Listing requires more information
An actual web-page back button, rather than just the browser back
Should be clearer that you're the current top bidder
More description needed for the rooms, detail lacking

5. **Find the list of user's currently active bids**
*User difficulty rating (Out of 5):* 4
*Supervisor comments*:
Activity tab name is bit vague
Countdown timer for how long until auction ends
Needs more information: property name, address
Maybe potential to re-bid on activity page

6. **Navigate to the listing that was previously bid on without searching the location**
*user difficulty rating (out of 5):* 1
*supervisor comments*:
Easy to navigate, but activity page was lacking description
Refer to comments in 5

7. **Message owner of the listing previously bid on**
*user difficulty rating (out of 5):* 1
*supervisor comments*:
Button to directly message host, instead of going to host profile
Message should refer to the property that was in question

8. **Create a listing**
*User difficulty rating (Out of 5):* 2
*Supervisor comments*:
Amenities list is slightly unintuitive. Bubbles?
Headings need to be reworded. New Item needs to be renamed

First glance, the home page is unclear what the purpose of the site is
