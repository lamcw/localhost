// Week 2
Formed our team of 4 - 'Undergrads'. We all decided to do project 3 and went
over some basic ideas on how the website would be structured, development
tools and also delegated roles and who would be focusing on which areas. I 
agreed to work on the front end with Jasper and while also being responsible
for tying the front and back ends together once they are both functional.
For the proposal I was delegated with the Aim and also assisting with Epics
and Project Methodology.

// Week 3
Completed the Aim for the proposal and wrote up the Final Epics selection 
after discussions with the team. Further refinement of our vision for our 
project, we are proceeding with a bidding concept and a minimalist UI design.
