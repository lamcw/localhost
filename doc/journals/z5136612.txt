Week 2

Group formed. We all agreed on doing topic 3. We brainstormed on what features
are going to be implemented for the web app. Tasks were assigned to each person
in the team. I am responsible for the backend of the project. Made a use case
diagram for the proposal. Helped write the epics in the proposal.

Week 3

We finalized and submitted the proposal. I started setting up the project with
Django framework and PostgreSQL.

Week 4

Had meetings on Wednesday and Thursday. Discussed about problems with our
current design and how to improve them. We then have a hack night on Friday
which we have finalized system design and started implementing them. Me and
Edward created ER model of our system and then mapped them to Django models.

Week 5

Finished backend for user sign up, log in, log out, reset password. Modified
models to reflect property hierachy, i.e. Property -> Room -> Bed. User can now
create listings.

Week 6

Listing creation page is completed. Integrated front-end stuff to django
framework. Wrote extensive tests for models. Modified user model so that we uses
email to authenticate users.

Week 7

Redesigned most of the model in backend. Migrate changes in model to views and
templates. Property details could be accessed through URL.
