# Week 2

Group formed with the other three undergraduates in the lab. Adopted the
role of scrum master. I created the Slack workspace, Trello team and project
board, and BitBucket repository. Managed each of the tasks on Trello and
assigned them to respective team members. Organised a second meeting to be
held on Wednesdays. Drafted the abstract, and project methodology sections of
the proposal document.
