# Week 2

Group formed with the other three undergraduates in the lab. Adopted the
role of scrum master. I created the Slack workspace, Trello team and project
board, and BitBucket repository. Managed each of the tasks on Trello and
assigned them to respective team members. Organised a second meeting to be
held on Wednesdays. Drafted the abstract, and project methodology sections of
the proposal document.

# Week 3

The group finished the project proposal. Compiled each of the sections for
the shared google docs page into a latex file and submitted for the group. Had
our first out of class meeting on Wednesday to discuss the direction of the
project. Further disussed what platforms and technologies to use and we decided
on the bootstrap and django frameworks with AWS for hosting. Everyone committed
to complete certain tasks within the next two weeks.

# Week 4

Official meetings ran successfully on Wednesday and Thursday. I organised
another unofficial meeting on Friday night that hopes to run weekly. This
week the team spent several hours discussing the different conceptual problems
with the current model and the model was changed accordingly with unanimously
agreed upon solutions. Steven and I focussed primarly on designing the user
interfaces and together we sketched a proposed design for each of the website
pages and presented them to the group for feedback. Together we implemented the
first version of the website homepage incorporating a search bar and researched
different APIs that can be used for the location autocomplete the project
requires.

# Week 5

Official meetings ran successfully on Wednesday and Thursday. The unofficial
friday night meetings are now running weekly. I worked on the homepage and
refactored much of the existing code so that the codebase is more modular. I
added features such as randomly generated search bar placeholder text and
randomly chosen wallpapers.

# Week 6

Official meetings ran, again, successfully on Wednesday and Thursday. The
unofficial friday meeting also went ahead. In order to meet the goal of the
sprint, I proposed another meeting on Sunday and we put in 20+ man hours extra.

This week I refactored the front end to depend on a fluxbox layout and with the
help of Steven migrated all the previous pages to the new codebase.
Additionally, I developed the log in, register and password reset pages.

Progress is on track.
