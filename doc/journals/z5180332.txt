# Week 2

Group formed with the other three undergraduates in the lab. Adopted the
role of scrum master. I created the Slack workspace, Trello team and project
board, and BitBucket repository. Managed each of the tasks on Trello and
assigned them to respective team members. Organised a second meeting to be
held on Wednesdays. Drafted the abstract, and project methodology sections of
the proposal document.

# Week 3

The group finished the project proposal. Compiled each of the sections for
the shared google docs page into a latex file and submitted for the group. Had
our first out of class meeting on Wednesday to discuss the direction of the
project. Further disussed what platforms and technologies to use and we decided
on the bootstrap and django frameworks with AWS for hosting. Everyone committed
to complete certain tasks within the next two weeks.
