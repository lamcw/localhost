Week 2
Agreed to do project 3. 
Initial idea is to incorporate a meta-search system into the current home rental websites like Airbnb. This would allow users to access properties listed on multiple websites on a single website. 
Allocated general roles for the project, such as scrum master and who's in charge of front end and back end. Tom and I were allocated back end. Tom and I were also in charge of writing up the epics for the proposal.

Week 3
We changed our concept to a bidding concept for last minute bookings. 
I wrote initial 6 epics, and Tom corrected my epics and added a few more. Proposal was completed on Saturday and submitted Sunday. 

Week 4
Setup my working environment. Finished designing the database with Tom. 
Began coding the backend on Friday night hack sesh. Began implementing our database design into Django. 

Week5
Changed database design to incorporate a Property->Room->Bed hierarchy. Tried different implementations of this design using abstraction and inheritance.
